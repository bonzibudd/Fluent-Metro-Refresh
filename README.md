### What is Fluent-Refresh?

This skin brings a refreshed look and full customization to Open-Shell Menu. It uses updated design elements with transparency and depth, following the design of Windows 11. 

#### Features include:
 - Automatic color scheme with light/dark modes
 - Customizable text and background colors
 - Various options for padding and layout sizes
 - Updated iconography and scalability of menu elements

### Installation
**Fluent-Refresh is designed for Windows 11. It is incompatible with Windows 7-10 (see [releases](https://github.com/bonzibudd/Fluent-Refresh/releases) for more details).**

You first need to install [Open-Shell](https://github.com/Open-Shell/Open-Shell-Menu/releases). Open-Shell is a highly regarded Start menu replacement for Windows used by many enthusiasts. During installation, you can choose to exclude the Explorer and IE integration, as it is not necessary for the Start menu feature.

To install, copy the `Fluent-Refresh.skin` and `.skin7` files into `C:\Program Files\Open-Shell\Skins` so the skin is recognized by Open-Shell. Next, navigate to the "Skins" tab, and from the dropdown, choose Fluent-Refresh (the name may vary on pre-release versions).

**(Optional) To enable the Tile interface,** select `Backup` -> `Load from XML File...` and select the XML file from the downloaded release. (Make sure to unzip!)

**And Voil√†!** The new interface will be applied on launch of the Start menu. You can further change the links for the tiles under "Customize Start Menu."

**If you notice that the menu looks off-color, set the** `Menu glass color` **to #858585 in Open-Shell Settings (under "Menu Look").** This will prevent your accent color from bleeding into the menu background.

**Have any questions?** Feel free to make a post in [discussions](https://github.com/bonzibudd/Fluent-Refresh/discussions).

### Configurations

Fluent-Refresh provides a variety of customization to get the menu looking exactly how you want. If you need clarification about what an option does, you can hover over the item for a description. If an option is incompatible with another, it will be disabled. **If you notice an issue with an option, please file a [bug report](https://github.com/bonzibudd/Fluent-Refresh/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=).** Options will be expanded and improved upon as updates are released.
